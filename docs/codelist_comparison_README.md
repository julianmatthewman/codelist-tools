## Codelist comparison

### About

Compare two codelists and look for any matches. You can get a codelist directly from the codelist maker or upload an existing codelist (a variety of file formats are supported). Select which column should be matched on (usually it will be the column containing the clinical code, such as ICD, SNOMED, Readcode, etc...) and if an entry has a match in the other column it will be highlighted in green, else in red.
